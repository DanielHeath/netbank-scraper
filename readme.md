# Netbank-scraper

Securely retrieve transaction logs from
Commonwealth Banks Netbank, and store them in
ledger format.

# Usage

This is a ruby project & I haven't put much work into making it easy for others to use.
You'll need a working ruby install with bundler.

 * Clone the code
 * Read the code in `bin/scrape.rb` to ensure you trust it.
 * `bundle install`
 * `bundle exec ./bin/scrape.rb`
